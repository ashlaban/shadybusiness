  <h1 id="a-day-in-the-park-or-the-ever-changing-name-of-the-wind">A day in the park; Or the ever changing name of the wind</h1>
  <p>Today was a day of total relaxation. It started early as my hostess had to leave for a confirmation. This left the whole day entirely at my disposal. A spent it as best I could reading the hell out of &#8220;The name of the wind&#8221; by Patrick Rothfuss. It took a while to come to like the book. It starts off in a way that to me is quite off putting, the main character is a genius kid and while the world certainly can be dark enough that even he has problems I am worried that I like him more because he&#8217;s successful in his undertaking more than anything else. However, Rothfuss has definite way with words and, to me, unique style partly consisting of an interesting technique of using stories within stories within stories. The multi-layered storytelling in some way reminiscing of &#8220;Inception&#8221;.</p>

  <p>Not all of the day was spent reading though. I walked the streets of Cambridge experiencing its wonders. Taking a tour around the town you notice that churches crop up almost everywhere and they are all beautiful. Cambridge had more than churches though, it is also University town and the University itself, or rather the first part of it, dates back to 1209. Since then a lot of money has been spent on making the buildings exquisite. In the shadow of the King&#8217;s College Chapel, a prime example of Gothic excellence, I found a spot for a suitable break.</p>

  <p>The place was a coffee shop serving an interesting mix of mocha and ice. I had my book from earlier with me and grabbing the cup of mocha ice I went for a table out in the sun. And sitting there I realised; This was why I had come to England in the first place. A good book, warm weather and a cold drink. What more can you ask for in life and not be overly presumptuous?</p>

  <h1 id="english-ceilidh-a-small-step-for-one-man">English Ceilidh; A small step for one man</h1>
  <p>I am exhausted, my brain is a little mushy and I&#8217;m more half deaf than usual. What happened you wonder. Ceilidh happened, that&#8217;s what! At this event I met lots of people. There was Ann-Harriet, Nantando, Lauren, the girl in the red dress, ponytail girl and a whole bunch of others! In total around 30 people showed up; Conversation was had, arms went flailing, feet were stamped, all to the rhythm of Celtic inspired folk music.</p>

  <p>English Ceilidh is a dance event, this one organised by a student organisation and held in one of the local churches. You have a band, a conductor telling everybody what to do and as many couples as can fit on the dance floor. The conductor takes some time to explain the current dance before the music starts. The dances are all fairly simple and basically everyone can join in; young or old, experienced or with two left feet. Just grab a partner and follow along.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was fantastic, many were new to the dances and spirits were high leading to very relaxed air and mistakes were plentiful but could easily be laughed away. Then the current dance ended, you said thank you for the dance and found a new partner for the next one.</p>

  <p>![Ceilidh dancing][img/ceilidh.jpg]</p>

  <p>I actually joined in on most of the dances! After the first dance I managed to stand in the middle of the room and look like a total fool and missed my opportunity at getting a partner. Embarrassed I walked of the stage and considered leaving as soon as I had the chance. I didn&#8217;t though. Instead I pushed through and found Rosie sitting the current dance out. I asked her for a dance and poof: I was in. From there the rest kind of managed itself, I stayed on the dance floor a couple of dances. Then there was an interlude which was awesome. For the final dances I was quite tired and sat some of them out but I made sure to catch one of the last ones as a challenge to myself (I was tempted to just quit at the end but it felt to cowardly).</p>

  <h1 id="waterstones-a-haven-for-book-lovers-yet-lacking-in-souls">Waterstones; A Haven for book lovers yet lacking in souls</h1>
  <p>When spending time in an English city there&#8217;s usually a lot of blokes around. The streets congested with people, cars and musicians. The whether rapidly shifting from a warm and sunny to rain and hail in the blink of an eye. You know how it is! In the midst of all that there is one oasis, one place of calm and piece of mind. That is Waterstones.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s a four storey bookshop really large enough to house all the books you could ever read. The layout is open and feels free. There is only one room on each floor and the books are arrange along the sides so that you have a large open area in the middle. Short bookshelves divide the walls into sections and the centre have tastefully placed tables covered with books on display. After spending an hour or more browsing there is a coffee shop available on the second floor with comfortable seating and a relaxed atmosphere. Two things should be noted: Firstly, this place is mainly focused on entertaining books and as such stock mainly novels and histories, not textbooks in Neural Science (for this you should see Cambridge University Press or a similar establishment). Secondly and more importantly, there is barley any Brandon Sanderson!</p>

  <p>A little context might be of use here for those that are not familiar with Mr. Sanderson. Sanderson is a fantasy writer made famous by being hand picked by Harriet McDougal to conclude the Wheel of Time series. His other works include Mistborn: The final empire and Elantris, both brilliant books with characters come to life, compelling and unique magic systems and a storytelling that keeps your eyes glued to the pages. He. Is. Simply. The. Best. Author. Around. Right. Now. .! Waterstones stocked in total five books by him. Three copies of Elantris and two of his latest epic The Way of Kings. I had hoped to be able to buy his latest creation The Emperors soul set in the same world as Elantris but in a different part.</p>

  <p>I can only conclude that Waterstones is a splendid place where every minute is well spent. It is well stocked and filled to the brim with the latest hits and the old classics. I also have to conclude that Mr. Sanderson is so popular as to sell out at a stellar rate leaving only five books on the shelf. I wanted to be disappointed when I left Waterstones that day but I just couldn&#8217;t bring me to feel that way. The shop had made an impression on me and I left satisfied with two purchases by my side.</p>

  <h1 id="english-pub-life-or-i-dont-mix-well-with-total-strangers">English pub life; Or I don&#8217;t mix well with total strangers</h1>

  <p>So basically, I am in England visiting a friend and what&#8217;s more English than the traditional pub. There is one chain particular that have cheap prices and still manage to serve you quality. This is what makes it perfect for a Friday student hang-out. I went with my hostess to meet up with a couple of her friends. There were Doctor Phil, Norris, Adele, Day, James, this girl that talks really fast and I. These were lovely people and it was a long time ago I heard common banter this relaxed and flowing. And it was hilarious.</p>

  <p>I however took on the stereotypical role of the mute Swede. After the introduction phase and a few tries at conversation I decided it was time to flee the field. I may make numerous excuses for my behaviour; That my English was rusty; That I am hard of hearing; That I was feeling tired after the trip or any other perfectly reasonable reason. The facts still stand though, I fled because if felt out of the loop with no way of getting in despite several attempts by my lovely hostess. That was actually quite cool to see, conscious attempts at directing a conversation.</p>

  <p>Feels like it&#8217;s about time to get to a point or conclude the telling. I fled. I bade good-bye to everyone and wished them a lovely evening. Too bad for me it would not include me.</p>
