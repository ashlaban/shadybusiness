			<p>In the <u>far</u> north, way beyond the African origin jungles; In the cold dark, where sometimes even the day lacks light; There lies a University, on the edge of civilisation, pushing the frontier.</p>
			<p>Stylish intros aside, LTU is comprised of five campuses: Kiruna, Skellefte&aring, Filipstad, Pite&aring and of course Luel&aring. In Kiruna the main focus of education is Space engineering and the campus is located close to Esrange. In Skellefte&aring the education focuses on game development and design. Mining and Metallurgy is the focus for the campus in Filipstad while music is what Pite&aring focuses on. The main campus in Lule&aring provides a plethora of educational opportunities.</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>In times long past, way, way back in 1971, the first stone to what would become Scandinavia's nothernmost university. Back in these days it was called "H&oumlgskoleenheten i Lule&aring", university status was not granted until 1997. A this time the named changed into what can still be recognised today, "Lule&aring University of Technology".</p>
			<p>What then has happened during the, as of now, 42 year history of the institution? To answer this </p>
			<h2>Numbers</h2>
			<p>To get a grip of what LTU is some interesting figures are presented below:</p>
			<!-- 19-dl,dt,dd -->
			<dl>
			<dt>Students</dt>
			<dd>Currently there are 17 000 number of students enrolled at LTU.</dd>
			<dt>Staff</dt>
			<dd>And there are so many staff! Exactly 1 600 of them.</dd>
			<dt>Computers</dt>
			<dd>The IT-department has to manage so(!) number of computers distributed among staff and computer labs.</dd>
			<dt>Buildings (Campus Lule&aring)</dt>
			<dd>At campus Luleå, there are at least six buildings in which education takes place!</dd>
			<dt>Societies</dt>
			<dd>So many societies in the university that the listing of the in pointless. Therefore this abbreviated number is provided instead: 42.</dd>
			<dt>Turnover</dt>
			<dd>Last year the turnover for LTU was approximately 1.4 billion SEK. Quite impressive don't you think?</dd>

			<h2>Professional Services</h2>
			<p>The professional services are a university-wide entity that ensures that the departments are running well. To achieve this they have distributed their activities to the departments and also provide overarching organisation at a central location. </p>
			<p>The current head of the professional services is Staffan Sarb&aumlck, which also happens to be the HEad of Administration. So if you have any problems, he should be sure to know. His contact information can be found <a href="http://www.ltu.se/staff/s/sasa-1.10065">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Faculty Boards</h2>
			<p>There are two faculty boards that help govern the education and organisational decisions needed for university operation. These are <em>The Board of the Faculty of Science and Technology</em> and <em>The Board of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences</em>; The first handles technical decision and the latter covers the humanity side.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="Purpose" class="hidden">
			<h1>Purpose</h1>
			<p>The purpose of LTU is to be a leading technical university, enabling attractive and sustainable solutions for modern problems. In order to achieve this goal there are a number of aspects that the university cares for. These are research, education and collaboration and are discussed below.</p>
			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>LTU provides research opportunities for a wide variety of subjects but there are a few subjects in which the university specialises. These are </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Attractive civil environments</li>
				<li>Effective innovation and organisation</li>
				<li>Future mining</li>
				<li>Renewable energy</li>
				<li>Innovative art and science</li>
				<li>Sustainable transportation systems</li>
				<li>Intelligent industrial processes</li>
				<li>Enabling ICT</li>
				<li>Smart machines and materials</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These research subjects form the basis on which the operation of LTU rests. For more information about a specific subject, the interested reader is advised to peruse <em>ltu.se</em>.
<!-- 			<p>There are a number of active research areas where active research is conducted within LTU. A few of the topics will be mentioned and followed by a more in-depth explanation of one of those areas.</p>
			<p>There are a number of research organisations within the departments of LTU. For example, the Department of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Space Engineering have the following sub-divisions.
			<ul>
				<li>EISLAB</li>
				<li>Space technology</li>
				<li>Systems and Interactions</li>
			</ul>
			The other departments have similar sub-divisions within them.</p>
			<p>Some of the ongoing areas of research are
				<ul>
					<li>Embedded Systems</li>
					<li>Space Engineering</li>
					<li>Ore Geology</li>
					<li>Solid Mechanics</li>
					<li>and others...</li>
				</ul>
			The interested reader is invited to learn more at <em>ltu.se</em>. -->
			</p>
			<h3>Ball bearings</h3>
			<p>One area where LTU is a centre of excellence is the area of ball bearing research. Recently a university technology centre, UTC, associated with SKF was established at LTU. Within this centre both master students and PhD. are invited to develop the cutting edge of condition monitoring. Just to mention one project developed there; A high-frequency sensor that mimics the processing performed by the human brain to perform analysis.</p>
			<p>This UTC is a global collaboration with the company SKF, but similar joint efforts are also conducted locally within the Luleå area. More can be read below.</p>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>LTU is a technological university and therefore provides mainly technical education. In Sweden a combined program corresponding to a bachelor and master's degree is the main form of education but the master and bachelor exists as separate entities as well. The areas which one can pursue at LTU are listed below.</p>
			<!-- 17-ul -->
			<!-- 18-li -->
			<ul>
				<li>Engineering Physics and Engineering Electronics</li>
				<li>Computer Science and Engineering</li>
				<li>Space Engineering</li>
				<li>Fire Engineering</li>
				<li>Architectural Engineering</li>
			</ul>
			For a complete list an interested reader is kindly advised to take a look at the university homepage, <em>ltu.se</em>.
			<h2>Local collaborations</h2>
			<p>LTU entertains good relationships with many local industry leaders. For example, LKAB and SSAB are to big partners that contribute to the research effort. In return LTU provides the people and the skills required to develop the cutting-edge.
			Many master's theses are written while working for one of these two companies, mainly within the material sciences, but there are many disciplines that are combined. Image analysis to automatically classify granules, thus improving pellet quality just to mention one.</p>
