It's raining threads!
=====================

I've been playing around with multi-threading and MEX-files recently.

Optimising code

master's thesis -> compute intensive algorithm.
parallel computing
	-> planning on using openCL
	-> multi-threading will have to do for now

naive multi-threading -> too many threads, too many context switches
switch parallelisation point -> just plain too many threads

implement thread pool
	-> neat stuff
	-> expensive to create thread contexts
	-> create them once and let them scan thruogh a list of jobs
	-> problem greatly simplified 'cause all jobs can be generated before hand
	-> great on large problems
