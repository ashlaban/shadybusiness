In a kingdom long ago and far, far away there lived once a wise King and a just Queen. They ruled the kingdom with a firm but fair hand and the land prospered.

## LAND IS PROSPEROUSE HERE ##

But one day the king fell ill and was afflicted by terrible seizures. Doctors, physicians and apothecaries surrounded the king day and night but they were unable to improve the king's condition. The Queen helplessly stood her husband by, never leaving his side. Being unable to do anything to help her love for the first time in her life she was distraught. One day the king spasmed hard, arching his back, every muscle in his body clenched tight. A few hoarse sounds let slip his throat, then he died. The Queen was devastated. She secluded herself from the world, for it was bereft all happiness. She refused to see anyone, refused to eat. Shortly thereafter she her mind left the world and her body fell cold.
