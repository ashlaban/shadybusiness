  <h1 id="a-day-in-the-park-or-the-ever-changing-name-of-the-wind">A day in the park; Or the ever changing name of the wind</h1>
  <p>Today was a day of total relaxation. It started early as my hostess had to leave for a confirmation. This left the whole day entirely at my disposal. A spent it as best I could reading the hell out of &#8220;The name of the wind&#8221; by Patrick Rothfuss. It took a while to come to like the book. It starts off in a way that to me is quite off putting, the main character is a genius kid and while the world certainly can be dark enough that even he has problems I am worried that I like him more because he&#8217;s successful in his undertaking more than anything else. However, Rothfuss has definite way with words and, to me, unique style partly consisting of an interesting technique of using stories within stories within stories. The multi-layered storytelling in some way reminiscing of &#8220;Inception&#8221;.</p>

  <p>Not all of the day was spent reading though. I walked the streets of Cambridge experiencing its wonders. Taking a tour around the town you notice that churches crop up almost everywhere and they are all beautiful. Cambridge had more than churches though, it is also University town and the University itself, or rather the first part of it, dates back to 1209. Since then a lot of money has been spent on making the buildings exquisite. In the shadow of the King&#8217;s College Chapel, a prime example of Gothic excellence, I found a spot for a suitable break.</p>

  <p>The place was a coffee shop serving an interesting mix of mocha and ice. I had my book from earlier with me and grabbing the cup of mocha ice I went for a table out in the sun. And sitting there I realised; This was why I had come to England in the first place. A good book, warm weather and a cold drink. What more can you ask for in life and not be overly presumptuous?</p>
