  <p>I am exhausted, my brain is a little mushy and I&#8217;m more half deaf than usual. What happened you wonder. Ceilidh happened, that&#8217;s what! At this event I met lots of people. There was Ann-Harriet, Nantando, Lauren, the girl in the red dress, ponytail girl and a whole bunch of others! In total around 30 people showed up; Conversation was had, arms went flailing, feet were stamped, all to the rhythm of Celtic inspired folk music.</p>

  <p>English Ceilidh is a dance event, this one organised by a student organisation and held in one of the local churches. You have a band, a conductor telling everybody what to do and as many couples as can fit on the dance floor. The conductor takes some time to explain the current dance before the music starts. The dances are all fairly simple and basically everyone can join in; young or old, experienced or with two left feet. Just grab a partner and follow along.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was fantastic, many were new to the dances and spirits were high leading to very relaxed air and mistakes were plentiful but could easily be laughed away. Then the current dance ended, you said thank you for the dance and found a new partner for the next one.</p>

  <p>I actually joined in on most of the dances! After the first dance I managed to stand in the middle of the room and look like a total fool and missed my opportunity at getting a partner. Embarrassed I walked of the stage and considered leaving as soon as I had the chance. I didn&#8217;t though. Instead I pushed through and found Rosie sitting the current dance out. I asked her for a dance and poof: I was in. From there the rest kind of managed itself, I stayed on the dance floor a couple of dances. Then there was an interlude which was awesome. For the final dances I was quite tired and sat some of them out but I made sure to catch one of the last ones as a challenge to myself (I was tempted to just quit at the end but it felt to cowardly).</p>
