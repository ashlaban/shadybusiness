  <p>So basically, I am in England visiting a friend and what&#8217;s more English than the traditional pub. There is one chain particular that have cheap prices and still manage to serve you quality. This is what makes it perfect for a Friday student hang-out. I went with my hostess to meet up with a couple of her friends. There were Doctor Phil, Norris, Adele, Day, James, this girl that talks really fast and I. These were lovely people and it was a long time ago I heard common banter this relaxed and flowing. And it was hilarious.</p>

  <p>I however took on the stereotypical role of the mute Swede. After the introduction phase and a few tries at conversation I decided it was time to flee the field. I may make numerous excuses for my behaviour; That my English was rusty; That I am hard of hearing; That I was feeling tired after the trip or any other perfectly reasonable reason. The facts still stand though, I fled because if felt out of the loop with no way of getting in despite several attempts by my lovely hostess. That was actually quite cool to see, conscious attempts at directing a conversation.</p>

  <p>Feels like it&#8217;s about time to get to a point or conclude the telling. I fled. I bade good-bye to everyone and wished them a lovely evening. Too bad for me it would not include me.</p>
