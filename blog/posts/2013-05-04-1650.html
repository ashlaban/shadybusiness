  <p>When spending time in an English city there&#8217;s usually a lot of blokes around. The streets congested with people, cars and musicians. The whether rapidly shifting from a warm and sunny to rain and hail in the blink of an eye. You know how it is! In the midst of all that there is one oasis, one place of calm and piece of mind. That is Waterstones.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s a four storey bookshop really large enough to house all the books you could ever read. The layout is open and feels free. There is only one room on each floor and the books are arrange along the sides so that you have a large open area in the middle. Short bookshelves spanide the walls into sections and the centre have tastefully placed tables covered with books on display. After spending an hour or more browsing there is a coffee shop available on the second floor with comfortable seating and a relaxed atmosphere. Two things should be noted: Firstly, this place is mainly focused on entertaining books and as such stock mainly novels and histories, not textbooks in Neural Science (for this you should see Cambridge University Press or a similar establishment). Secondly and more importantly, there is barley any Brandon Sanderson!</p>

  <p>A little context might be of use here for those that are not familiar with Mr. Sanderson. Sanderson is a fantasy writer made famous by being hand picked by Harriet McDougal to conclude the Wheel of Time series. His other works include Mistborn: The final empire and Elantris, both brilliant books with characters come to life, compelling and unique magic systems and a storytelling that keeps your eyes glued to the pages. He. Is. Simply. The. Best. Author. Around. Right. Now. .! Waterstones stocked in total five books by him. Three copies of Elantris and two of his latest epic The Way of Kings. I had hoped to be able to buy his latest creation The Emperors soul set in the same world as Elantris but in a different part.</p>

  <p>I can only conclude that Waterstones is a splendid place where every minute is well spent. It is well stocked and filled to the brim with the latest hits and the old classics. I also have to conclude that Mr. Sanderson is so popular as to sell out at a stellar rate leaving only five books on the shelf. I wanted to be disappointed when I left Waterstones that day but I just couldn&#8217;t bring me to feel that way. The shop had made an impression on me and I left satisfied with two purchases by my side.</p>
